# Load Test Results
We simulated the load test for 1000 users for a period of 15 seconds as mentioned.

**Application Under Test(AUT):** Wordpress Web Application(hosted locally on Docker)

### Before Test Run
**Median of Response time - 326ms**

### During Test Run
**Median of Response time before test run - NA**(Application was blocked)

## Observation
The load test with 1000 simultaneous users blocked the Web Application Response completely.

Optimal Application Response time falls in the range of **a few microseconds to 1 second**.

A response time of more than a second generally leads to loss of revenue for the business 
due to customer dissatisfaction and churn. That's why measuring the Application performance is very critical.
